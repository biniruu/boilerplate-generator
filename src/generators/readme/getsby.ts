const getGatsbyDesc = () => `## Beginning Gatsby project

If you want to use Gatsby with themes, use the starters provided by Gatsby. You can choose and install the necessary starter libraries from [Gatsby Starter Library](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/).

## Creating Gatsby project

The gatsby-config.ts is configured based on the following options.

\`\`\`text
✓ Will you be using JavaScript or TypeScript?
• TypeScript

✓ Will you be using a CMS?
• No (or I'll add it later)

✓ Would you like to install a styling system?
• PostCSS

✓ Would you like to install additional features with other plugins?
• Add responsive images
• Add an automatic sitemap
• Generate a manifest file
• Add Markdown and MDX support
\`\`\`

If you don't want to configure the options yourself, use the command \`gatsby new [folder name]\`. Refer to the [Gatsby.js documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/getting-started/part-1/#create-a-gatsby-site) to set up the basic settings for Gatsby.`
